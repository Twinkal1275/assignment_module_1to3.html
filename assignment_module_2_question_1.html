<!--Question-1
    Do search for domain, hosting, SEO etc.

    Answer:-

     A domain name is the part of your Internet address that comes after "www". For example, in Tutorialspoint.com the domain name is 
    tutorialspoint.com. A domain name becomes your Business Address so care should be taken to select a domain name. Your domain name should
     be easy to remember and easy to type. -->





     <!-- What is host in HTML?
The host property sets or returns the hostname and port part of the href attribute value. The href attribute specifies the destination of a 
link in an area. Note: If the port number is not specified in the URL (or if it is the scheme's default port - like 80, or 443), some browsers
 will not display the port number. -->
